# Code Refactoring
An exercise of refactoring code for accessibility and search engine optimization, in this case for a "marketing agency" website. Processes involved changing non-semantic HTML tags into semantic HTML tags and editing CSS accordingly to maintain the inital styling and functionality of the webpage. Alt attributes were added to images for accessibilty, and a clear title was added for search engine optimization.
